 *
 * Lustre OST Proxy Device (OSP) is the agent on the local MDT for the OST
 * or remote MDT.
 *
 * OSP object attributes cache
 * ---------------------------
 * OSP object is the stub of the remote OST-object or MDT-object. Both the
 * attribute and the extended attributes are stored on the peer side remotely.
 * It is inefficient to send RPC to peer to fetch those attributes when every
 * get_attr()/get_xattr() called. For a large system, the LFSCK synchronous
 * mode scanning is prohibitively inefficient.
 *
 * So the OSP maintains the OSP object attributes cache to cache some
 * attributes on the local MDT. The cache is organized against the OSP
 * object as follows:
 *
 * struct osp_xattr_entry {
 *	struct list_head	 oxe_list;
 *	atomic_t		 oxe_ref;
 *	void			*oxe_value;
 *	int			 oxe_buflen;
 *	int			 oxe_namelen;
 *	int			 oxe_vallen;
 *	unsigned int		 oxe_exist:1,
 *				 oxe_ready:1;
 *	char			 oxe_buf[0];
 * };
 *
 * struct osp_object_attr {
 *	struct lu_attr		ooa_attr;
 *	struct list_head	ooa_xattr_list;
 * };
 *
 * struct osp_object {
 *	...
 *	struct osp_object_attr *opo_ooa;
 *	spinlock_t		opo_lock;
 *	...
 * };
 *
 * The basic attributes, such as owner/mode/flags, are stored in the
 * osp_object_attr::ooa_attr. The extended attributes will be stored
 * as osp_xattr_entry. Every extended attribute has an independent
 * osp_xattr_entry, and all the osp_xattr_entry are linked into the
 * osp_object_attr::ooa_xattr_list. The OSP object attributes cache
 * is protected by the osp_object::opo_lock.
 *
 * Not all OSP objects have an attributes cache because maintaining
 * the cache requires some resources. Currently, the OSP object
 * attributes cache will be initialized when the attributes or the
 * extended attributes are pre-fetched via osp_declare_attr_get()
 * or osp_declare_xattr_get(). That is usually for LFSCK purpose,
 * but it also can be shared by others.

/**
 * Implement OSP layer dt_object_operations::do_declare_attr_set() interface.
 * XXX: NOT prepare set_{attr,xattr} RPC for remote transaction.
 *
 * According to our current transaction/dt_object_lock framework (to make
 * the cross-MDTs modification for DNE1 to be workable), the transaction
 * sponsor will start the transaction firstly, then try to acquire related
 * dt_object_lock if needed. Under such rules, if we want to prepare the
 * set_{attr,xattr} RPC in the RPC declare phase, then related attr/xattr
 * should be known without dt_object_lock. But such condition maybe not
 * true for some remote transaction case. For example:
 *
 * For linkEA repairing (by LFSCK) case, before the LFSCK thread obtained
 * the dt_object_lock on the target MDT-object, it cannot know whether
 * the MDT-object has linkEA or not, neither invalid or not.
 *
 * Since the LFSCK thread cannot hold dt_object_lock before the (remote)
 * transaction start (otherwise there will be some potential deadlock),
 * it cannot prepare related RPC for repairing during the declare phase
 * as other normal transactions do.
 *
 * To resolve the trouble, we will make OSP to prepare related RPC
 * (set_attr/set_xattr/del_xattr) after remote transaction started,
 * and trigger the remote updating (RPC sending) when trans_stop.
 * Then the up layer users, such as LFSCK, can follow the general
 * rule to handle trans_start/dt_object_lock for repairing linkEA
 * inconsistency without distinguishing remote MDT-object.
 *
 * In fact, above solution for remote transaction should be the normal
 * model without considering DNE1. The trouble brought by DNE1 will be
 * resolved in DNE2. At that time, this patch can be removed.
